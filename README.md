 Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
 What did you do particularly well?
    
      The Client was DriverPass.
      
      DriverPass wanted us to design a system that takes advantage of a void in the market pertaining to the training 
      for students who are going to take their driving test at their local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

      I was able to do well on the Business Requirments Document.



      
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

      I would choose to revise the Powerpoint presentation. I would add more detail to the speaker notes.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

      I read over the transcript and made notes on what the different actors within DriverPass wanted their system to be able to do.
     
      If you do not consider the users needs when designing a system it could be very difficult for the end user to accomplish what they 
      are trying to achive by using the system. In this case if the customer was not considered in design of the system it would be difficult for
      them to purchase a package or schedual a driving lesson.

      Designing software takes a systematic approach to creating a solution that is usable by the customer and their client. you must
      understand the requirements, create a design plan, follow the plan, and refine that plan.

      I will use UML diagrams to visualize the system, and a businees requirments document as a starting point to plan out the SDLC.
